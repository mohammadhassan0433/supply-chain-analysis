Retail Supply Chain Data Analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a retail store's supply chain data (73,100 records) to gain insights on inventory levels, sales, demand forecasting, and seasonality.  
I used Python to clean, aggregate, and visualize the data.

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Key Steps
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of units sold, revenue trends, and seasonality patterns
- Creation of heatmaps to highlight monthly revenue trends

## 📊 Insights
- **Top-selling product:** P0016 (by units sold)
- **Seasonality:** Revenue peaks during specific months, suggesting seasonal demand
- **Revenue patterns:** Clear monthly trends and competitor pricing effects
